This is the repository for our plagerism dectector. 

train.cxx scans a single c file for a number of markers, which it returns as an array of floats

dataAnalysis.cxx bootstraps our samples

final.cxx reads in a new file to compute if it is likely plagerized. This should be the only file that
the user must manuelly call

There is a makefile and main is located in final.cxx

1pasword1 is also Ben Rapkin

We have adhered to the honor code on this project.
