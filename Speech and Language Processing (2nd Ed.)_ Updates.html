  				  <h3><a id="Chapter1" name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Introduction </h3>
					<p>This chapter is largely the same with updated history and pointers to newer applications.  <a id="" title="Chapter 1 PDF" name="" href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Emartin/SLP/Updates/1.pdf"><img src="SLP2/pdficon_small.gif" alt="PDF for Chapter 1" align="top" border="0" height="17" width="17"></a>  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

				  <h3><a id="Chapter2" name="chapter2"></a>Chapter 2: Regular Expressions and Automata </h3>
					<p>This chapter is largely the same with some bug fixes.    <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

				  <h3><a id="Chapter3" name="chapter3"></a>Chapter 3: Words and Transducers </h3>
					<p>This
new version of the chapter still focuses on morphology and FSTs, but is
expanded in various ways. There are more details about the formal
descriptions of finite-state transducers, many bugs are fixed, and two
new sections are added relating to words and subwords. The first new
section is on word and sentence tokenization, including algorithms for
English as well as the maxmatch algorithm for Chinese word
segmentation. The second new section is on spelling correction and
minimum edit distance, and is an extended version of the edit-distance
section from Chapter 5 of the first edition, with clearer figures for
example for explaining the minimum-edit-distance backtrace.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>
					<h3><a id="Chapter4" name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: N-grams (Formerly Chapter 6) </h3>
					<p>This
updated language model chapter has had a complete overhaul. This draft
includes more examples, a more complete description of Good-Turing,
expanded sections on practical issues like perplexity and evaluation,
language modeling toolkits, including ARPA format, and an overview of
modern methods like interpolated Kneser-Ney.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

				  <h3><a id="Chapter5" name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5: Part-of-Speech Tagging (Formerly Chapter 8)</h3>
					<p>
The main change to this revised chapter is a greatly expanded, and
hence self-contained, description of bigram and trigram HMM
part-of-speech tagging, including Viterbi decoding and deleted
interpolation smoothing. Together with the new Chapter 6, this allows
a complete introduction to HMMs for courses that don't use the speech
recognition chapters. Other changes in this chapter include expanded
descriptions of unknown word modeling and part-of-speech tagging in
other languages, and many bug fixes. Finally, we've moved this chapter
earlier in the book.
  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>



<h3><a id="Chapter6" name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6: Hidden Markov and Maximum Entropy Models (Formerly part of Chapter 7 and Appendix D)</h3>
<p>
This new chapter introduces two sequence models: HMMs and MEMMs.
It gives the details of  Hidden Markov Models,
including Forward, Viterbi, and EM. It then introduces MaxEnt models,
begining with linear regression, followed by logistic regression, then the extension
to MaxEnt, and finally the MEMM and the Viterbi intuition.

new significantly-expanded speech recognition chapter gives a complete
introduction to HMM-based speech recognition, including extraction of MFCC
features, Gaussian Mixture Model acoustic models, and embedded training.  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

<h3><a id="Chapter10" name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10: Speech Recognition: Advanced Topics (New Chapter) </h3>
				<p>This new second chapter on speech
recognition covers advanced topics like decision-tree clustering for context-dependent
phones, advanced decoding (including n-best lists, lattices, confusion networks, 
and stack decoding), robustness (including MLLR adaptation), discriminative training,
and human speech recognition.  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>


<h3><a id="Chapter11" name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11: Computational Phonology (Formerly parts of Chapters 4, 5, and 7)</h3>

including phonological and morphological learning, finite-state models,
OT, and Stochastic OT.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font>


					<h3><a id="Chapter12" name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12: Formal Grammars of English (Formerly 9)</h3>
					<p>This
chapter still focuses on CFGs for English and includes a revamped and
somewhat expanded grammar for the ATIS domain. New and expanded
sections cover: treebanks with a focus on the Penn Treebank, searching
treebanks with tgrep and tgrep2, heads and head-finding rules,
dependency grammars, Categorial grammar, and grammars for spoken
language processing.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>


<h3><a id="Chapter13" name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13: Syntactic Parsing (Formerly 10)</h3>
					<p>The
focus of this chapter is still on parsing with CFGs. It now includes
sections on CKY, Earley and agenda-based (chart) parsing. In addition,
there is a new section on partial parsing with a focus on machine
learning based base-phrase chunking and the use of IOB tags.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

<h3><a id="Chapter14" name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14: Statistical Parsing (Formerly 12)</h3>

<p>
This statistical parsing chapter has been extensively revised. It now
covers PCFGs, probabilistic CKY parsing, parent annotations, the Collins parser,
and touches on advanced topics such as discriminative reranking and parsing for
language modeling.
  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

<h3><a id="Chapter15" name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15: Features and Unification (Formerly 11)</h3>

languages. It now has better coverage of model-theoretic semantics for
meaning representations, and a new section on Description Logics and
their role as a basis for OWL and its role in the Semantic Web.   <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>


<h3><a id="Chapter18" name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18: Computational Semantics (Formerly 15)</h3>
<p>This chapter covers compositional approaches to semantic analysis at the sentence level. The primary focus is
on rule-to-rule approaches based on lambda-expressions. It also now has new coverage of unification-based
approaches to computational semantics.  Coverage in the old chapter 15 on semantic grammars has been moved to the
discourse chapter; coverage of information extraction has been expanded and moved to the new chapter 22. 
  <font size="-2"><a href="#top">(top)</a></font></p>

<h3><a id="Chapter19" name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19: Lexical Semantics (Formerly 16)</h3>
